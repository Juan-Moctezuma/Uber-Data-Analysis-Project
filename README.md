# Uber Data Analysis Project

### Introduction

What is Uber?
The Uber platform allows the user (passenger) to request a ride to the closest Uber partner (driver) using a mobile application, and the driver decides if he/she accepts the customer's request. However, the driver cannot select the user or their respective destination. After the trip is completed or closed, the user is charged a fee that directly depends on the distance travelled, the trip's duration, dynamic pricing and other variables. 

What is the Uber Data Analysis Project?
This project is based entirely on the results of an 8-month period project in which a simple survey along with the recorded data from an independent contractor’s mobile application (Uber partner/driver app) brought together my study’s main dataset.
This experiment examines and discusses people’s opinion about a specific location, and points out the external factors that could highly influence their view. I directly performed a two-question survey to passengers and wrote down the results after completing trips requested by an Uber user.

### Project's steps
1. Launched a 2-question survey from May to December 2017 while working as an Uber Partner/Driver regarding:
	* Where the passenger(s) is/are originally from.
 	* What do they like the most about San Diego, CA.
2. Recorded and compiled the passenger’s opinion in an Excel file.
3. Analyzed the attributes that make San Diego an appealing location for many individuals.
4. Combined the passengers’ information recorded on the Uber Partner’s mobile app with the collected survey's data.
5. Created visuals displaying relevant data not only from the survey but from other observed patterns as well!
